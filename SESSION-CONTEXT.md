# Linear MCP Session Context - Resumption Prompt

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-28
**Branch**: feature/all-improvements
**Status**: Ready for next phase

---

## What We're Doing

We're systematically improving the Linear MCP server by:

1. **Completed**: Added 3 new tools to Linear MCP
   - `linear_update_issue` - Update single issues
   - `linear_link_issues` - Create issue relationships (blocks, related, duplicate)
   - `linear_unlink_issues` - Remove relationships
   - Fixed `linear_delete_issues` batch deletion bug (now uses parallel execution)

2. **Just Completed**: Created 12 improvement issues in Linear organized into 3 phases
   - **Phase 1 (Performance)**: 6 issues - 30-50% API call reduction focus
   - **Phase 2 (Resilience)**: 3 issues - Rate limiting & retry logic
   - **Phase 3 (Architecture)**: 3 issues - Code quality & maintainability

3. **Milestones Assigned**: All 12 issues now assigned to correct phase milestones

## Current Issues Being Tracked

### Phase 1 - Performance Improvements (LOC-411 to LOC-416)
- LOC-411: Pre-import GraphQL operations (1-2h)
- LOC-412: Complete error handling (1-2h)
- LOC-413: In-memory caching layer (2-3h)
- LOC-414: Input validation schemas (2-3h)
- LOC-415: Runtime type checking (2-3h)
- LOC-416: Query batching (3-4h) **[URGENT]**

### Phase 2 - Resilience (LOC-417 to LOC-419)
- LOC-417: Rate limiting middleware (2h)
- LOC-418: Exponential backoff retry (2h)
- LOC-419: Rate limit monitoring (1-2h)

### Phase 3 - Architecture (LOC-420 to LOC-422)
- LOC-420: Refactor LinearAuth classes (3-4h)
- LOC-421: Domain-specific errors & logging (2-3h)
- LOC-422: Handler lifecycle hooks (3-4h) **[URGENT]**

## Key Information

**Project**: Linear.app MCP improvements
**Repository**: /home/marty/repos/linear-mcp/
**Team**: LOCOMOTIVE (LOC-*)
**Build**: `/home/marty/repos/linear-mcp/build/index.js`

**Previous Work**:
- Tested all 3 new tools with real API (LOC-390 through LOC-396 test issues created and cleaned up)
- Verified no regressions in existing tools
- Discovered correct Linear API relationship types: blocks, related, duplicate
- All 56 unit tests still passing

**Documentation Created**:
- `REMAINING-IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Original roadmap of all improvements
- `CREATED-LINEAR-ISSUES.md` - Summary of 12 issues created
- `MANUAL-TEST-RESULTS.md` - Complete testing results
- `TESTING-COMPLETE-SUMMARY.md` - Testing overview

## Quick Reference

**Branch Status**: `feature/all-improvements` (production ready)
**Issues Created**: 12 (all with full task enrichment)
**Milestones**: Assigned âœ…
**Next Step**: Implementation (start with Phase 1 quick wins)

**Quick Win Starting Points**:
1. LOC-411 (Pre-import ops) - 1-2 hours, immediate 5-10ms savings
2. LOC-412 (Error handling) - 1-2 hours, better robustness
3. LOC-417 (Rate limiting) - 2 hours, prevent API limit hits
