## ðŸš€ Migration Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Prepare Files (30 minutes)

```bash
cd /home/marty/repos/linear-mcp

# 1. Create LICENSE file
cat > LICENSE << 'EOF'
[MIT License content from MIGRATION-PLAN.md]
EOF

# 2. Create ATTRIBUTION.md
cat > ATTRIBUTION.md << 'EOF'
[Attribution content from MIGRATION-PLAN.md]
EOF

# 3. Replace README.md
mv README.md OLD-README.md
mv NEW-README.md README.md

# 4. Update package.json
# Manually edit with new name, description, author, repository URL

# 5. Commit changes
git add LICENSE ATTRIBUTION.md README.md OLD-README.md package.json
git commit -m "chore: prepare for standalone repository publication"
```

### Phase 2: Create GitHub Repository (10 minutes)

1. **Create new repo** on GitHub:
   - Name: `linear-mcp` (or `locomotive-linear-mcp`)
   - Owner: `locomotive-agency` (or your organization)
   - Description: "Production-grade Linear MCP server with enterprise resilience"
   - Public repository
   - **Don't initialize** with README/LICENSE (we have our own)

2. **Update local remotes**:
```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote remove fork
git remote add origin https://github.com/locomotive-agency/linear-mcp.git
```

3. **Push to new repository**:
```bash
git push -u origin main
git push -u origin feature/all-improvements  # If you want to preserve it
```

### Phase 3: Setup Repository (20 minutes)

1. **Configure GitHub**:
   - Add topics/tags
   - Update description
   - Configure repository settings

2. **Create release**:
```bash
git tag -a v2.0.0 -m "Release v2.0.0: Production-grade Linear MCP"
git push origin v2.0.0
```

3. **Create GitHub release**:
   - Tag: v2.0.0
   - Title: "v2.0.0 - Production-Grade Linear MCP"
   - Description: Copy from PROJECT-COMPLETE.md

### Phase 4: npm Publication (Optional, 15 minutes)

```bash
# Verify package
npm pack --dry-run

# Login to npm
npm login

# Publish
npm publish --access public
```

### Phase 5: Verification (10 minutes)

Test installation in a fresh environment:

```bash
# Clone from new repo
git clone https://github.com/locomotive-agency/linear-mcp.git test-install
cd test-install

# Build
npm install
npm run build

# Test
npm test

# Verify in Claude Code
# (Add to ~/.claude.json and test)
```
