# Attribution

This project builds upon the excellent foundation of [cline/linear-mcp](https://github.com/cline/linear-mcp) by the Cline team.

## Original Project
- **Repository**: https://github.com/cline/linear-mcp
- **Purpose**: Basic Linear MCP integration for Cline
- **License**: Not specified

## Our Enhancements
We've added significant production-grade features:
- Enterprise resilience (rate limiting, retry logic, monitoring)
- Performance optimization (query batching)
- Clean architecture (lifecycle hooks, modular auth, domain errors)
- Comprehensive test coverage (145 new tests)

**Total Additions**: 5,116 lines of code beyond the original implementation.

## Credits
- **Original Authors**: Cline team
- **Enhanced By**: LOCOMOTIVE Agency
- **Maintained By**: Marty Martin (marty@locomotive.agency)

Thank you to the Cline team for creating the foundational MCP server that inspired this work.

### Step 2: Create New GitHub Repository

**2.1: Create repo on GitHub**
- Name: `linear-mcp` or `locomotive-linear-mcp`
- Description: "Production-grade Linear MCP server with enterprise resilience and performance optimization"
- Public/Private: Public (recommended)
- Initialize: **Do NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or LICENSE (we have our own)

**2.2: Remove old remote, add new remote**
```bash
cd /home/marty/repos/linear-mcp

# Remove existing remotes
git remote remove origin
git remote remove fork

# Add new remote (replace with your actual URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/locomotive-agency/linear-mcp.git

# Verify
git remote -v
```

**2.3: Push to new repository**
```bash
# Push main branch
git push -u origin main

# Push feature branch (if you want to preserve it)
git push -u origin feature/all-improvements

# Push all tags (if any)
git push --tags
```

---

### Step 3: Update Repository Files

**3.1: Replace README.md**
- See NEW-README.md (will be created next)
- Highlights improvements
- Multi-client installation guide
- Comprehensive feature list

**3.2: Add/Update files**
```bash

# Update package.json
git add package.json
git commit -m "chore: update package metadata for standalone repo"

# Push changes
git push
```

---

### Step 4: npm Publication (Optional)

**4.1: Prepare for npm**

npm login

# Publish (scoped package recommended)
npm publish --access public
```

**4.3: Update README with npm install**
Add to installation section:
```bash
npm install -g @locomotive/linear-mcp
```

---

### Step 5: GitHub Repository Setup

## üö® Important Considerations

### Attribution
- ‚úÖ ATTRIBUTION.md clearly credits original authors
- ‚úÖ README mentions it's based on cline/linear-mcp
- ‚úÖ No license conflicts (original has no explicit license)

### Naming
Options:
1. `linear-mcp` (simple, direct)
2. `locomotive-linear-mcp` (branded)
3. `linear-mcp-pro` (positions as enhanced version)

**Recommendation**: `linear-mcp` with `@locomotive` npm scope

### Versioning
- Start at v2.0.0 to indicate major enhancements
- Follow semver for future releases
